# Travel Helper Agent

## Introduction

Before you travel, you need to know some essential pre-departure information such as the entry rules for the country 
you're travelling to, the weather in the destination, the currency of the destination, top tourist spots and so on. 
Of course, you can search this information for every trip but that takes time and it's so old school! 

Instead, let's build a travel helper agent! This agent gathers the necessary information about your upcoming trip 
and provides essential pre-departure information you need for your trip.

Travel Helper Agent will rely on other agents to help. Let's start with the first one. 

## Greeter Agent

The greeter agent will greet the user and gather the necessary information about the upcoming trip. 

Go through [greeter](./sub_agents/greeter) to build the agent and come back here once done.
